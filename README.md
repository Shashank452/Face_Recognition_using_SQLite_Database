# **Face Recognition using SQLite Database**

This repository contains a project that implements a face recognition system using OpenCV and SQLite. The system can detect and recognize faces from live video or images and store user data in an SQLite database for future reference.

## **Features**
- Capture and store facial images.
- Perform face recognition using OpenCV's advanced image processing capabilities.
- Save and retrieve user details (e.g., name, ID, and face encodings) in an SQLite database.
- Simple and scalable code structure.

---

## **Technologies Used**
- **Python**: Programming language used for the project.
- **OpenCV**: For face detection and recognition.
- **SQLite**: Lightweight database to store face data and user details.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations and matrix operations.

## **Setup and Installation**

### **Clone the Repository**
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash 
git clone https://github.com/Shashank452/Face_Recognition_using_SQLite_Database.git
cd Face_Recognition_using_SQLite_Database
```

---

### **Install Dependencies**
